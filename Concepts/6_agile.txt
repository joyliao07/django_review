(The Next Sprint)

Within each sprint, the development team builds and tests a functional part of the product until the product owner accepts it and the functionality becomes a potentially shippable product.

Scrum teams deliver product features in increments at the end of each sprint. A product release occurs at the end of a sprint or after several sprints.

Review the process! Review the process! Review the process! (Repeat..)
