SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol):


    SOAP Envelope:
        Header
        Body
          WSDL: XML (or other format)
        HTTP (or other protocol)


    - XML based language for describing web services
    - WS Security: SOAP defines its own security known as WS Security
    - A JavaScript example:


    <script type="text/javascript">
        function soap() {
            var xmlhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
            xmlhttp.open('POST', 'https://somesoapurl.com/', true);

            // build SOAP request
            var sr =
                '<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>' +
                '<soapenv:Envelope ' + 
                    'xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" ' +
                    'xmlns:api="http://127.0.0.1/Integrics/Enswitch/API" ' +
                    'xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" ' +
                    'xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">' +
                    '<soapenv:Body>' +
                        '<api:some_api_call soapenv:encodingStyle="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/">' +
                            '<username xsi:type="xsd:string">login_username</username>' +
                            '<password xsi:type="xsd:string">password</password>' +
                        '</api:some_api_call>' +
                    '</soapenv:Body>' +
                '</soapenv:Envelope>';

            xmlhttp.onreadystatechange = function () {
                if (xmlhttp.readyState == 4) {
                    if (xmlhttp.status == 200) {
                        alert(xmlhttp.responseText);
                        // alert('done. use firebug/console to see network response');
                    }
                }
            }
            // Send the POST request
            xmlhttp.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'text/xml');
            xmlhttp.send(sr);
            // send request
            // ...
        }
    </script>



REST (Representational State Transfer):



SOAP VS REST Clients:

A SOAP client works like a custom desktop application, tightly coupled to the server. There's a rigid contract between client and server, and everything is expected to break if either side changes anything.

A REST client is more like a browser. It's a generic client... A client is supposed to enter a REST service with zero knowledge of the API, except for the entry point and the media type. In SOAP, the client needs previous knowledge on everything it will be using, or it won't even begin the interaction.


More Comparison:


SOAP: SOAP is a protocol. 
REST:  REST is an architectural style.

SOAP: "Simple Object Access Protocol"  
REST: "Representational State Transfer"

SOAP: SOAP can't use REST because it is a protocol.  
REST: REST can use SOAP web services because it is a concept and can use any protocol like HTTP,      SOAP.

SOAP: SOAP defines standards to be strictly followed. 
REST: REST does not define too much standards like SOAP.

SOAP: SOAP requires more bandwidth and resource than REST.
REST: REST requires less bandwidth and resource than SOAP.

SOAP: SOAP defines its own security.
REST: RESTful web services inherits security measures from the underlying transport.

SOAP: SOAP permits XML data format only.
REST: REST permits different data format such as Plain text, HTML, XML, JSON etc.


REST (Representational State Transfer):

A REST API defines a set of functions which developers can perform requests and receive responses via HTTP protocol such as GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE. 

    - The client and server are independent of each other allowing either to be coded in any language
    - Easy to test
    1) Clientâ€“server: The client handles the front end the server handles the backend and can both be replaced independently of each other.
    2) Stateless: No client data is stored on the server between requests and session state is stored on the client.
    3) Cacheable: Clients can cache response (just like browsers caching static elements of a web page) to improve performance
